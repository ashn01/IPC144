1. Using function reduce an amount of program code, and it is reusable.
2. If pointer is used, a function can return more than one value.
3. if an valuable has declared in global scope, it can be called anywhere; however, if an valuable has declared in a local scope, it can only be called within the local scope, for example, a function called A has integer i, and another function called B has interger i. C language doesn't allow to declare valuable with duplicated name, but compiler doesn't say error because both are declared in each local scope.
