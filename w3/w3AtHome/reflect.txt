1) for, while, do-while

2) when user want to excute a code at least one time, do while is better than while loop.

3) conditional expression is that if it is true, excute an operand between ? and :, and if it is false, excute an operand following :.
for example, a = b > 5 ? 3 : 4;
if b is greater than 5, a = 3, else a = 4.
